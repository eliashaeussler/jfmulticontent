# TYPO3 extension jfmulticontent

I have developed the existing jfmulticontent extension for the TYPO3 version 8.7. I am continuing the work for TYPO3 9 now.

The extension t3jquery seems not to exist any more and TYPO3 10 will provide jQuery for extensions. Any support for t3jquery will therefore be dropped soon.
